# AVL Tree & Hash Table Text Analyzer

A C program that analyzes word frequencies in text files using:
- **AVL Trees** for sorted storage and traversal
- **Hash Tables** (with chaining) for efficient lookups

## Features
- 📂 File loading with non-alphabetical character filtering
- 🔢 Word frequency tracking
- ⚖️ Self-balancing AVL trees (LSR/RSR/LRDR/RLDR rotations)
- ⛓️ Hash table collision handling with linked lists
- 📊 Statistics (most frequent words, threshold filtering)
